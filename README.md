This is the first project in the Python learning course [www.hexlet.io](www.hexlet.io)

This package contains few simple games:

* Check even `brain-even` - (_a number in the range from 1 to 30 is given, you need to determine its parity, answer only "yes" or "no"_)
* Calculator `brain-calc` - (_you need to calculate the result of the expression (For example 15 + 8)_)
* Greatest common divider `brain-gcd` - (_you need to find the greatest common divisor of given numbers (For example 14 7)_)
* Arithmetic progression `brain-progression` - (_you need to find what number is missing in the progression (For example 13 19 25 31 .. 43 49 55 61 67)_)
* Prime number `brain-prime` - (_a number in the range from 2 to 100 is given, you need to determine whether the number is prime, answer only "yes" or "no"_)

#### Usage
* Check even `make brain-even`
* Calculator `make brain-calc`
* Greatest common divider `make brain-gcd`
* Arithmetic progression `make brain-progression`
* Prime number `make brain-prime`
