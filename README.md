This is the first project in the Python learning course [www.hexlet.io](www.hexlet.io)

This package contains few simple games:

* Check even `brain-even` - (_a number in the range from 1 to 30 is given, you need to determine its parity, answer only "yes" or "no"_)
* Calculator `brain-calc`
* Greatest common divider `brain-gcd`
* Arithmetic progression `brain-progression`
* Prime number `brain-prime`
